## Differentiating between ETL, ELT, and EtLT in the context of compliance with the legal requirements in an industry.

**ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**

In ETL data is extracted from source systems and transformed in a dedicated staging area before being loaded into the target data warehouse.

**ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)**

Effective in cloud-native environments, where data is loaded into a data lake or warehouse in its original raw format before any transformation occurs.

**EtLT (Extract, [minimal] Transformation, Load, Transform)**

It is a hybrid approach specifically designed to address privacy and data protection regulations with minimal transformation.

| Primary Compliance Value | Ensures data is "clean" before storage| High auditability and lineage tracking    | Protects individual privacy by removing Personally Identifiable Information before storage           |
